    <h2>Hi I'm Emily Lewis</h2>
    <h3>I'm a front-end Web Developer currently enrolled in the Web Development 
        bootcamp at Thinkful.</h3>
    <h3>I pride myself in being highly dedicated, 
        effective at collaborating with colleagues and working independently, 
        and being driven to succeed.</h3>
     <h3>When I'm not immersed in coding, I can also be found 
        reading, watching movies with my cat Peter, scuba diving, 
        baking, spending time outdoors, and enjoying a hoppy IPA.</h3>
     <h3>Feel free to take a look at some of my projects and reach out to me at emilytessalewis@gmail.com.</h3>
